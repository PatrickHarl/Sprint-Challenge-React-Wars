1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

ReactJS is a javascript library for building UI's. It makes building components much faster and easier as well as handling DOM manipulation for us. It is very fast and highly optimized.

1. Describe component state.

A component state is a variable that is set to a particular value and stored inside a component. When this variable is updated (changes state), the render() method is invoked.

1. Describe props.

Props are pieces of data that are passed between React components, similar to how we pass in arguments to a function when we call it. Props are often used to pass state to other components.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?

Side effects are manipulations of the DOM that do not get removed naturally when a React component is unmounted. You work with useEffect() to sync effects in a React component with changes to a certain state or props.
